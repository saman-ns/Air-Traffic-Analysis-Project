Air Traffic Analysis Project:
The Air Traffic Analysis Project represents a deep dive into the aviation industry's data, underscoring my skills in SQL and data analytics. This project was crafted with a dual focus: to offer valuable business insights for investment decisions in the airline industry and to showcase my SQL expertise.

Project Background:
Working with a dataset comprising flight details and airport information for 2018 and 2019, the project aims to answer critical business questions for a hypothetical investment fund interested in airline stocks. The data, sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, includes various aspects like flight dates, delays, cancellations, distances, and specific airport data.

Data Description:
The primary dataset is split into two tables - 'flights' and 'airports'. The 'flights' table encompasses a range of data points from flight dates to delays, while the 'airports' table provides detailed information about each airport involved.

Key Objectives and SQL Techniques:

Analyzing Flight Data: I started by assessing basic flight data to understand trends in flight counts, cancellations, and reasons for delays. This involved grouping, counting, and sorting data using SQL functions.

Yearly Comparison: A significant portion of the analysis was dedicated to comparing data between 2018 and 2019. This included creating new tables to track changes in miles traveled and the number of flights for each airline, which helped in understanding year-over-year operational shifts.

Operational Insights: Investigating the most popular airports and the average distance traveled per aircraft for each airline provided insights into operational efficiency and potential cost implications. This was done using join operations, subqueries, and aggregate functions.

On-time Performance Analysis: The project also delved into on-time performance, categorizing flights based on the time of day and analyzing delays. This part of the analysis provided an understanding of how time-of-day impacts airline punctuality.

Optimization and Performance: A critical aspect of this project was to demonstrate SQL query optimization techniques. By using different query strategies, I illustrated how to achieve the same results with varying execution efficiencies.

Conclusion and Business Insights:
The project concluded with a set of recommendations for the fund managers based on the data analysis. These insights included which airlines showed growth potential, which airports were key hubs for operations, and how operational factors like on-time performance could impact airline profitability.

Skills Demonstrated:

Proficient use of SQL for data querying and manipulation.
Ability to translate data into meaningful business insights.
Knowledge of query optimization and performance improvement.
Effective communication of technical analysis to a non-technical audience.
Project Repository Contents:

Annotated SQL scripts detailing the queries and their purpose.
Data files used for the analysis.
A comprehensive report summarizing the findings and business recommendations.
This project not only exhibits my technical prowess in handling complex datasets but also reflects my ability to draw strategic business conclusions from data analytics.
